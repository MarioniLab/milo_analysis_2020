```{r sup-fig-refined,  fig.cap="(ref:sup-fig-refined)", echo=FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("suppl_figs/suppl_fig_refined.pdf", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

(ref:sup-fig-refined) **Random sampling of KNN graph vertices is suboptimal compared to sampling with refinement.**
(A) Sampling with refinement leads to selection of fewer neighbourhoods 
(B) Sampling with refinement leads to selection of bigger neighbourhoods for DA testing, independently of the initial proportion of cells sampled
(C) Sampling with refinement generates robust neighbourhoods across initializations: for each index cell we calculate the distance from the closest index in a sampling with different initialization. The cumulative distribution of distances to the closest index is shown. The black dotted line denotes the distribution of distances between K nearest neighbours in the dataset (K=30) (NH: neighbourhood). 
Neighbourhood statistics were calculated using a simulated trajectory dataset of 5000 cells. All plots show results from three sampling initializations for each proportion.

The neighbourhoods overlapping true DA cells ($p_{c'}>0.6$) are highlighted in red.

Points are single cells coloured by the P(Condition 1). (B) Increasing the number of replicates reduces the difference between the true simulated and estimated effect sizes, using the mean squared error (MSE; top panel) and increases the testing true positive rate (TPR; bottom panel). (C) Increasing k marginally reduces the estimation variance (top panel), and has less of an impact on power (bottom panel) compared to increased replication.
